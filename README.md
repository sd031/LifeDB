LifeDB

Extreamly Lightweight NoSqlType JSON based lightning fast database with intelligent caching mechanism.

Got a PHP website? Awsm, Have idea about JSON and used them in your project? BINGO you are ready to use LifeDB and increase the site's performance up to almost 80%

This is the source code for LifeDB. This small lightweight lightning first database is for mobile apps. I have tested the database with my Moto E and the famous world city database. The output speed and other performance study is just jawDropping.

Initially I used PHP for development but also this easy algorythm can be implemented in any language i believe.

I'm using a page based locking system for executing the database transaction like MyISAM database engine. Further documentation is coming soon
