LifeDB
======

Extreamly Lightweight NoSqlType JSON based lightning first database with intelligent caching mechanism targeting mobile, tablet apps.

This is the source code for LifeDB. This small lightweight lightning first database is for mobile apps. I have tested the database with my Moto E 
and the famouse world city database. The output speed and other performence study is just jawDropping.

Inintially I used PHP for development but also this easy algorythm can be implemented in any language i believe.

I'm using a page based locking system for executing the database transaction like MyISAM database engine. Further documentation is coming soon
